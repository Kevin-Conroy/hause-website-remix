            On a base level, the term 'blood harmony' is simple—it describes the
          specific sound two siblings make when they sing together. Given that
          Dave Hause has been writing and recording songs with his younger
          brother Tim for a while now, it made sense to use that phrase as the
          title for his fifth solo record. But this being a Dave Hause album
          also means there's much more to it than that. Beneath the surface of
          Blood Harmony, in fact, are multiple layers of meaning relating to
          Hause's role as a musician, a brother, a husband, a son and—having
          become a father to twins a few months before the release of 2019's
          Kick—a dad. As such, Blood Harmony is also a reassertion of what
          family means to him. Even more so because it's coming out on the label
          owned by he and his brother. “I thought Blood Harmony was a great
          title” says Hause, “and really specific to how Tim and I have decided
          to work over the years. It also pertains to my children because
          they'll have their own Blood Harmony. So the germ of the album, the
          beating heart, is that I'm in a true family. I have a grounded reason
          to work and a bunch of people that I want to make proud with the work
          that we do. It's a family business.” The importance of that was made
          all the more apparent after the coronavirus outbreak. Hause, with his
          brother, used that unexpected downtime to make the Patty/Paddy tribute
          EPs to Patty Griffin and Dillinger Four's Patrick 'Paddy' Costello.
          After a while, though, like all touring musicians, he found himself
          without an income. So when his friend and former manager offered him
          some work nearby as a Covid safety supervisor for the company she set
          up after contracting Covid herself, he said yes. It was for one of the
          biggest celebrities in the world, so to prepare, Hause went to LA and
          worked on two shoots with two of music's biggest stars. He was shocked
          at the scant disregard their teams had for their well-being. “These
          artists are so successful they never need to work again,” says Hause,
          “but the label and management were pushing to get away with stuff and
          it was totally unsafe. I was pretty disgusted seeing the industry at
          that level, and how much of it was simply greed and not caring about
          the safety of others. We were just starting to roll out the EPs on our
          own label, and the whole experience just ironed my resolve—I'm a
          family artist, and I never want to be in a position where people are
          urging me to do things that are bad for my or my family's mental or
          physical health. That's not what it's about for me. It's about
          connection. So that experience really reinforced this idea of blood
          harmony. I'm connected to my people, and this is a small little thing
          that we're going to keep pure.” You can hear Hause's passion and
          dedication to his craft—as well as his determined approach to
          it—flowing through the veins of Blood Harmony's ten stunning,
          sumptuous songs. Written with his brother over a series of weekly
          FaceTime sessions, they began crafting songs together in January 2021.
          They'd been writing remotely together since 2017's Bury Me In Philly
          so it wasn't an entirely new process for them, but they modified their
          approach slightly by giving themselves rigid deadlines. “We decided to
          get together on Mondays,” explains Hause, “to figure out what we
          wanted to work on, and by Friday we had to have something you could
          sing to someone who wasn't a songwriter. It could be bad, but I didn't
          want to just have vague ideas. We called it 'Pencils-Down Fridays'.
          Over the course of three-and-a-half months, we ended up with 26
          songs.” They traveled with ten of those to Nashville, where acclaimed
          songwriter Will Hoge took up the helm of producer. Through Hoge's
          connections, what Hause calls “a staggering bunch of musicians” was
          assembled to flesh out the songs he and Tim had written. He's not
          wrong. There was Brandi Carlile's drummer Chris Powell, Bruce
          Springsteen And The E Street band bassist Garry Tallent, acclaimed
          session guitarist Tom Bukovac, Jason Isbell's guitarist Sadler Vaden,
          and keyboardist Billy Justineau, Mike Webb, and Jen Gunderman, who
          have played with the likes of Eric Church, Sheryl Crow, and more.
          Hause is the first to admit that it was a world away from the punk
          rock scene he'd made his name with as frontman of The Loved Ones.
          “They say that when you work in any field, you're happiest when you
          initially get the respect of your peers,” he says. “Thankfully, I've
          had that respect for some time now. But in this situation, these
          people were not our peers. They've operated at the highest level of
          the music business that is even possible, so to get their respect was
          so gratifying. Their kindness and commitment to making the record
          great because they liked the songs was tremendous. I keep saying that
          if anybody else likes the record, that's icing on the cake, because
          the way we wrote and made it was so wonderful.” While nobody would say
          the quality of Hause's previous albums was lacking, making Blood
          Harmony with those musicians was nevertheless a concerted effort to
          ramp it up. And it does. It begins with “Northstar”, a tender paean to
          the direction, comfort and joy his wife and twins have given him that
          also drives home the emotional resonance and sense of family at the
          center of this album. It's followed immediately by “Sandy Sheets”, a
          nostalgic trip into a past long-gone that references the Gin Blossoms'
          “Hey Jealousy” in its chorus, and which sounds every bit as iconic as
          that track. The gorgeous, lilting, paradise of “Hanalai” captures that
          rare sense of peace when you're with the person you love and nothing
          else matters, “Surfboard” injects some rare, good-natured humor into
          the trials and tribulations of being working class—something that
          remains, as ever, an undercurrent here—while “Carry The Lantern” and
          its life-affirming, almost Thin Lizzy-esque riffs double down Hause's
          commitment to his sobriety and his family. “A lot of being an adult
          for me is recommitting to your better angels instead of chasing your
          own tail,” he says. “That song is about facing temptation but
          redoubling your efforts to stay committed to the higher things that
          compel us to be better.” It's followed by the gorgeous album closer
          “Little Wings”. Hause calls it a post-script, but it resonates much
          more deeply and feels more significant than that. In fact, it ends the
          album the same way it begins—with a tender song for and about his
          twins that's full of the purest love and hope. It's impossible to not
          hear and feel just how much they and his whole family—that beating
          heart at the center of these songs—mean to him. It's a truly beautiful
          thing.
